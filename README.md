# IFSP_WEB_1st_semester

## This repository

- This repository is a form of keep track of all the activities that will be necessary for this subject.
- In it I'll create folders for each activity the teacher asks to submit.
- The MainProject folder is the most important of this repository, since this will be the main form of assessment.
- The changelog is referent only to the MainProject folder, so are the tags and releases.
